# Signal module (WIP)

Files added:
- `include/Signal.h`
- `src/Signal.cpp`

Status: Work-in-progress — these files intentionally incomplete and committed for version history.

Purpose: Add a `Signal` class to implement trading signal strategies (e.g., SMA-based trend signals). The current interface includes `strategyInterface` and `SMATrendStragegy` placeholders.

Notes:
- These files are intentionally left incomplete and may not compile cleanly on their own.
- They are added for tracking progress and enabling future PRs that finish the implementation.
